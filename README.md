Hi there! This is my AQA Computer Science NEA 2024-2025:
- Made an ATS for TRL (Website application)
- In case you git clone this, make sure you venv into the folder either from:
      - (macOS/Linux) source env/bin/activate (in project folder directory)
      - (Windows) .\env\scripts\activate.bat
- Ensure you run npm install in the frontend directory
